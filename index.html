                Hi, my name is Julia Cassidy. I am 22 years old and live in Manchester, New Hampshire. I am a recent graduate of the University of New Hampshire. I received my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing in May of 2019. For the past two years, I was a marketing and communications intern at UNH Career and Professional Success.

            <br>
                I have ridden horses competitively for 15 years and have owned a horse for 8 years. I own one horse, Brandy, who is a 16 year old thoroughbred cross mare. I have ridden jumpers, dressage, and some eventing. Aside from horseback riding, my other interests include hiking, running, football, hockey, photography, and videography. I am an avid crime show watcher, coffee lover, dog enthusiast, and amateur ukulele player. I am a self proclaimed die hard Pittsburgh Steelers fan even though I grew up in New England. I have been to a Super Bowl and two Stanley Cup Playoff games.
